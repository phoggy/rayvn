# rayvn
### A simple bash package manager.


# CLI

`USAGE: rayvn <command> [options]`

rayvn install [family

without domain, installs self.

# Publishing Projects

Project names are _**global**_ and must be published to be accessible from the `rayvn` command. Publication requires 
the following steps:
                   
### Fork the `rayvn-roost/rayvn-global` Repo
                                      
This is where you will commit files (on a branch) and submit PRs to update the global registry.

1. Navigate to the [rayvn-global registry](https://github.com/rayvn-roost/rayvn-global).
2. Click the Fork button.
3. Clone your fork locally.


### Register as an Admin

1. Create a `'rayvn_local'` GitHub repo and clone it locally.
2. Use the `rayvn admin PATH` command, where `PATH` points to the root of the cloned `'ravn_local'` repo.
3. Edit the generated `rayvn.admin` file to include name, url, address(es) and project names.
4. Commit and push the `rayvn.admin` file. 
5. Submit a PR on your `rayvn-global` repo containing `"register admin <your GitHub username>"`
6. Once committed, move on to Register Project.                       

##### The `rayvn.admin` File

```bash 
# rayvn-local registry administrator

admin.id = rayvn-D005C2CF-B421-4C73-80B0-45E52491EBFD
admin.created = 1742263053   # 2025-03-17_18.57.33_PDT

admin.name = NAME                      # Replace NAME with your preferred name (no need to match username)
admin.email = EMAIL                    # Replace EMAIL with one or more contact email addresses, comma separated.
admin.roost = https://github.com/USER  # Replace USER with your GitHub username.
```

### Register Project

1. Use the `rayvn project PATH` command, where `PATH` points to the root of your `'rayvn_local'` repo.
2. Edit the generated `rayvn.project` file and change the `project.name` to your desired project name.
3. Commit and push the `rayvn.project` file.
4. Submit a PR on your `rayvn-roost/rayvn-global` fork containing `"register project <your GitHub username>"`

##### The `rayvn.project` File

```bash 
project.id = GUID          # generated by rayvn project command.
project.create = TIME  # generated by rayvn project command.
project.name = <name>      # the desired project name, does not have to match a project repo name.
```
