# rayvn
### A simple package manager.

"A simple bash shared library system, enabling `require 'project/library'` to load libraries."


### Installation

```bash
$ brew tap phoggy/homebrew-rayvn # hopefully a temporary step
$ brew install rayvn
```
# CLI

`USAGE: rayvn <command> [options]`

rayvn install PATH-TO-PROJECT

without path, installs self.
               

# Developing With Raven

## Using rayvn within scripts

The following line in your script will activate rayvn:
```bash
source "${HOME}/.rayvn/boot.sh" &> /dev/null || { echo 'rayvn not installed'; exit 1; }
```

After that line executes, you now have a `require` function which should then be used to load any installed shared library.
Nearly all scripts will want to include the 'core' library provided by `rayvn`:
```bash
require 'rayvn/core'
```
and now you have the core set of functions available for your use. To see them:
```bash
raven list 'rayvn/core'
```

Note that if you look at library source files, any function with leading `_` is *internal* and subject to change;
use at your own peril!

## Developing rayvn projects

First `cd` to the directory where you want your project to live, then:
```bash
$ rayvn create project "my-name"
```
This will generate a skeleton project.

# Publishing Projects

Project names are _**global**_ and must be published to be accessible from the `rayvn` command. Publication requires 
the following steps:
                   
### Fork the `rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry` Repo
                                      
This is where you will commit files (on a branch) and submit PRs to update the global registry.

1. Navigate to the [rayvn-registry](https://github.com/rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry).
2. Click the Fork button.
3. Clone your fork locally.

### Register Your Project

1. Use the `rayvn project PATH <name>` command, where `PATH` points to the `projects` directory of your `'rayvn-registry'` fork.
2. Edit the generated `<name>` file and change the `project.name` to your desired project name.
3. Commit and push the `rayvn.project` file.
4. Submit a PR on your `rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry` fork containing `"register project <your GitHub username>"`

##### The `rayvn.project` File

```bash 
project.id = GUID          # generated by rayvn project command.
project.created = TIME  # generated by rayvn project command.
project.name = NAME      # the desired project name, does not have to match a project repo name.
```
