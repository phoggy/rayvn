# rayvn
### A simple bash package manager.


# CLI

`USAGE: rayvn <command> [options]`

rayvn install [family

without domain, installs self.

# Publishing Projects

Project names are _**global**_ and must be published to be accessible from the `rayvn` command. Publication requires 
the following steps:
                   
### Fork the `rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry` Repo
                                      
This is where you will commit files (on a branch) and submit PRs to update the global registry.

1. Navigate to the [rayvn-registry](https://github.com/rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry).
2. Click the Fork button.
3. Clone your fork locally.

### Register Your Project

1. Use the `rayvn project PATH <name>` command, where `PATH` points to the `projects` directory of your `'rayvn-registry'` fork.
2. Edit the generated `<name>` file and change the `project.name` to your desired project name.
3. Commit and push the `rayvn.project` file.
4. Submit a PR on your `rayvn-roost/rayvn-registry` fork containing `"register project <your GitHub username>"`

##### The `rayvn.project` File

```bash 
project.id = GUID          # generated by rayvn project command.
project.created = TIME  # generated by rayvn project command.
project.name = NAME      # the desired project name, does not have to match a project repo name.
```
